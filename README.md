# Numerical Derivative Method
The numerical derivative have three methods to solve the differential equation problem numerically, such as Forward Differenece, Backward Difference and Center Difference.
# Usage
All the programs have same function to be solved in this package, that is ![f(x) = x^2](https://i.upmath.me/svg/f(x)%20%3D%20x%5E2), the quadratic equation. In matemathically, when derivative is applied for quadratic equation, the result become linear equation ![f(x) = 2x](https://i.upmath.me/svg/f(x)%20%3D%202x).

There are three parameters input have to set
  - Initial Boundary = 0
  - Final Boundary = 10
  - Data length = 100

The results are shown in PNG files
