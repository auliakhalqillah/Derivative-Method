# Numerical Derivative Method
The numerical derivative have three methods to solve the differential equation problem numerically, such as Forward Differenece, Backward Difference and Center Difference. The methods have been implemented in Fortran 95 program in this package, so make sure you have Fortran 95 compiler in your computer.
# The Package
There are three Fortran 95 programs and one matlab script to plot the results:
1. Forwarddifference.f95
2. Backwarddifference.f95
3. Centerdifference.f95
4. plot_difference_method.m (Matlab)
# How To Use?
All the programs have same function to be solved in this package, that is f(x) = x^2, the quadratic equation. In matemathically, when derivative is applied for quadratic equation, the result become linear equation f(x) = 2x.

There are three parameters input have to set
  - Initial Boundary = 0
  - Final Boundary = 10
  - Data length = 100

The results are showed in PNG files
