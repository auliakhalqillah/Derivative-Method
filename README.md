# Numerical Derivative Method
The numerical derivative have three methods to solve the problem equation through numeric method, such as Forward Differenece, Backward Difference and Center Difference. The methods have been implemented in Fortran 95 program, so make sure you have Fortran 95 compiler in your computer.
# The Packages
There are three Fortran 95 programs and one matlab script to plot the results:
1. Forwarddifference.f95
2. Backwarddifference.f95
3. Centerdifference.f95
4. plot_difference_method.m (Matlab)
